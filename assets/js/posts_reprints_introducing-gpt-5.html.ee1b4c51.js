The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.

Accordingly, we’ve added new evaluations to stress‑test open-ended factuality.

In the past, ChatGPT relied primarily on refusal-based safety training: based on the user’s prompt, the model should either comply or refuse. While this type of training works well for explicitly malicious prompts, it can struggle to handle situations where the user’s intent is unclear, or information could be used in benign or malicious ways. Refusal training is especially inflexible for dual-use domains such as virology, where a benign request can be safely completed at a high level, but might enable a bad actor if completed in detail.</p><p>For GPT‑5, we introduced a new form of safety-training — safe completions — which teaches the model to give the most helpful answer where possible while still staying within safety boundaries. Sometimes, that may mean partially answering a user’s question or only answering at a high level. If the model needs to refuse, GPT‑5 is trained to transparently tell you why it is refusing, as well as provide safe alternatives. In both controlled experiments and our production models, we find that this approach is more nuanced, enabling better navigation of dual-use questions, stronger robustness to ambiguous intent, and fewer unnecessary overrefusals. Read more about our new approach to safety-training, as well as full details on methodology, metrics, and results, in our <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-safe-completions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">safe completion paper</a>.</p><p>Safety and helpfulness (given safe responses) across prompt intent types.

These personalities, available initially for text chat and coming later to Voice, let you set how ChatGPT interacts—whether concise and professional, thoughtful and supportive, or a bit sarcastic—without writing custom prompts. The four initial options, Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd, are opt-in, adjustable anytime in settings, and designed to match your communication style.</p><p>All of these new personalities meet or exceed our bar on internal evals for reducing sycophancy.</p><p>We look forward to learning and iterating based on early feedback.</p><h3 id="comprehensive-safeguards-for-biological-risk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comprehensive-safeguards-for-biological-risk"><span>Comprehensive safeguards for biological risk</span></a></h3><p>We decided to treat the “GPT‑5 thinking” model as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain, and have implemented strong safeguards to sufficiently minimize the associated risks. We rigorously tested the model with our safety evaluations under our <a href="https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preparedness Framework</a>, completing 5,000 hours of red-teaming with partners like the CAISI and UK AISI.</p><p>Similar to our approach for ChatGPT Agent, while we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm–our <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/18a02b5d-6b67-4cec-ab64-68cdfbddebcd/preparedness-framework-v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined threshold</a> for High capability–we are taking a precautionary approach and are activating the required safeguards now in order to increase readiness for when such capabilities are available. As a result, “GPT‑5 thinking” has a robust safety stack with a multilayered defense system for biology: comprehensive threat modeling, training the model to not output harmful content through our new safe completions paradigm, always-on classifiers and reasoning monitors, and clear enforcement pipelines.</p><p>Read more about our robust safety approach for GPT‑5 in our <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-system-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system card</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="gpt‐5-pro" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gpt‐5-pro"><span>GPT‑5 pro</span></a></h2><p>For the most challenging, complex tasks, we are also releasing GPT‑5 pro, replacing OpenAI o3‑pro, a variant of GPT‑5 that thinks for ever longer, using scaled but efficient parallel test-time compute, to provide the highest quality and most comprehensive answers. GPT‑5 pro achieves the highest performance in the GPT‑5 family on several challenging intelligence benchmarks, including state-of-the-art performance on GPQA, which contains extremely difficult science questions.</p><p>In evaluations on over 1000 economically valuable, real-world reasoning prompts, external experts preferred GPT‑5 pro over &quot;GPT‑5 thinking&quot; 67.8% of the time. GPT‑5 pro made 22% fewer major errors and excelled in health, science, mathematics, and coding. Experts rated its responses as relevant, useful, and comprehensive.</p><hr><h2 id="how-to-use-gpt‐5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-use-gpt‐5"><span>How to use GPT‑5</span></a></h2><p>GPT‑5 is the new default in ChatGPT, replacing GPT‑4o, OpenAI o3, OpenAI o4-mini, GPT‑4.1, and GPT‑4.5 for signed-in users. Just open ChatGPT and type your question; GPT‑5 handles the rest, applying reasoning automatically when the response would benefit from it. Paid users can still select <strong>“GPT‑5 Thinking”</strong> from the model picker, or type something like ‘think hard about this’ in the prompt to ensure reasoning is used when generating a response.</p><hr><h2 id="availability-and-access" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#availability-and-access"><span>Availability and access</span></a></h2><p>GPT‑5 is starting to roll out today <strong>to all Plus, Pro, Team, and Free users, with access for Enterprise and Edu coming in one week</strong>. Pro, Plus, and Team users can also start coding with GPT‑5 in the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codex CLI</a> by signing in with ChatGPT.</p><p>As with GPT‑4o, the difference between free and paid access to GPT‑5 is usage volume. Pro subscribers get unlimited access to GPT‑5, and access to <strong>GPT‑5 Pro</strong>. Plus users can use it comfortably as their default model for everyday questions, with significantly higher usage than free users. Team, Enterprise, and Edu customers can also use GPT‑5 comfortably as their default model for everyday work, with generous limits that make it easy for entire organizations to rely on GPT‑5. For ChatGPT free-tier users, full reasoning capabilities may take a few days to fully roll out. Once free users reach their GPT‑5 usage limits, they will transition to <strong>GPT‑5 mini</strong>, a smaller, faster, and highly capable model.</p><hr><h2 id="author" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#author"><span>Author</span></a></h2><p><a href="https://openai.com/news/?author=openai#results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a></p><hr><h2 id="footnotes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#footnotes"><span>Footnotes</span></a></h2><p><em>We find that the default grader in MultiChallenge (GPT-4o) frequently mis-scores model responses.
