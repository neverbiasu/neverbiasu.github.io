The shared outcomes have begun to appear, and the beautiful images continue to heal my heart and occupy my disk space daily. (This is a fortunate situation.

One issue is that there are as many as 25 parameters, and the lack of established methods for evaluating output results and models makes verification challenging.

Also, there&#39;s a possibility that <strong>&quot;breakdowns in the overall or background are not due to IN&#39;s influence (meaning M to OUT might be responsible)&quot;</strong> (discussed later).</p><p>(A somewhat extreme hypothesis) Looking at Seed:2 or Seed:3 vertically, we see a back-and-forth between anime and realistic styles. This might indicate the influence of that layer&#39;s handling of art style (anime/realistic). If this hypothesis is correct, <strong>&quot;the upper layers of IN handle realistic style, while the lower layers handle anime style&quot;</strong>.

A major difference from normal output was that in Seed 4&#39;s result, the pink skirt was lost.</p><p>The M_00 layer, when losing its model influence, seems to significantly impact the output. (M_00&#39;s result loses the pink skirt, while IN_11 and OUT_00 before and after maintain it) On the other hand, the fact that it doesn&#39;t completely break down like the upper OUT layer results might be because the upsampling process + skip connection in the OUT block after M_00 somehow manages to maintain consistency. (Going from M_00 to OUT_00, it recovers to the same atmosphere as IN_11)</p><p>From this, it seems that <strong>&quot;M_00 has an important/non-recoverable influence on overall details&quot;</strong>.</p><hr><h3 id="observation-3-everything-breaks-down-after-out-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#observation-3-everything-breaks-down-after-out-04"><span>Observation 3: Everything breaks down after OUT_04</span></a></h3><figure><img src="https://assets.st-note.com/img/1671812065106-D30xRLslqB.png?width=1200" alt="Image 8" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Image 8</figcaption></figure><p>From OUT_04 to upper layers, there were disturbances in overall composition, background, and the entire image. ~The final form? Indeed, one cannot resist the ascending burden...~ In OUT_06, the character was barely hanging on.</p><p>The upper OUT layers should be at the stage where the whole is upsampled by U-Net&#39;s inverse convolution. Having lost model influence at this point, correct upsampling might be impossible. Also, the fact that the character somewhat remained in OUT_06 suggests that parts that have gained strong features up to that point (in this case, the character) remain, but weaker parts (like the background and other areas) are lost. Furthermore, the fact that the character&#39;s face breaks down significantly around OUT_04 to OUT_05 suggests that these layers have a major influence on face formation.</p><p>From this, it seems that <strong>&quot;the upper OUT layers influence the overall reproduction of the output image&quot;</strong>. Also, <strong>&quot;the upper OUT layers influence expressions other than the main subject (e.g., background)&quot;</strong>.
