It <strong>expands short or sparse prompts</strong> by aligning them with the distributions seen in our model’s training data. The result is higher fidelity images and tighter prompt–image alignment.</li><li><strong>Mood Enhancer:</strong> A custom LLM-based pipeline that <strong>transforms minimal input into detailed, evocative image prompts</strong>. By leveraging a fixed system prompt and few-shot examples (with an advanced KV caching strategy), it can generate rich descriptions from sparse input <strong>at a fraction of the usual LLM cost</strong> and latency.</li></ol><p>Together, Tag Booster and Mood Enhancer <strong>reduce the burden on creators</strong> to hand-craft lengthy prompts, while <strong>consistently yielding higher-quality, on-target generations</strong>. In this post, we’ll dive into how each component works, the technical innovations under the hood, and why this is a game-changer for Illustrious users.</p><hr><h2 id="from-sparse-to-rich-how-tag-booster-enriches-prompts-with-tipo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#from-sparse-to-rich-how-tag-booster-enriches-prompts-with-tipo"><span><strong>From Sparse to Rich: How Tag Booster Enriches Prompts with TIPO</strong></span></a></h2><p>Creating a vivid image from a one-liner prompt is challenging – diffusion models like Illustrious XL were trained on datasets where prompts/captions have a certain richness and variety. <strong>Tag Booster</strong> bridges this gap by <strong>automatically expanding and refining your prompt</strong> to look more like those in the training distribution. It’s powered by our in-house <strong>TIPO framework</strong>, a lightweight multi-task language model purpose-built for prompt optimization.</p><figure><img src="https://illustrious-prod.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blog/2025-05-26T05:38:52.406Z/tipo architecture.png" alt="Image: TIPO Architecture" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Image: TIPO Architecture</figcaption></figure><h3 id="what-is-tipo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-tipo"><span><strong>What is TIPO?</strong></span></a></h3><p>TIPO stands for <strong>Text-to-Image Prompt Optimization</strong> – a novel approach that uses a <strong>small, efficient model</strong> trained on prompt pairs. It learned to take a simple prompt and output a richer one, adding details while preserving the original intent. This yields <em>significantly improved visual quality, coherence, and detail</em> compared to using the raw prompt.</p><h3 id="joint-task-training-tags-↔-text" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#joint-task-training-tags-↔-text"><span><strong>Joint-task Training (Tags ↔ Text)</strong></span></a></h3><p>TIPO handles both <strong>tag lists and natural language</strong> and converts one to the other. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Input:</strong> autumn forest</li><li><strong>Tag Booster Output:</strong> autumn forest, golden sunlight, falling leaves, high detail, masterpiece, warm color palette</li></ul><p>By adding details and stylistic tags, the enriched prompt better matches the training data, yielding <strong>higher-fidelity images</strong> with minimal extra effort.</p><hr><h2 id="vivid-narratives-with-less-effort-mood-enhancer-and-llm-powered-expansion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vivid-narratives-with-less-effort-mood-enhancer-and-llm-powered-expansion"><span><strong>Vivid Narratives with Less Effort: Mood Enhancer and LLM-Powered Expansion</strong></span></a></h2><p>While Tag Booster excels at <strong>adding relevant keywords and tags</strong>, <strong>Mood Enhancer</strong> transforms brief ideas into rich, atmospheric prompts using a <strong>custom Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline</strong>.</p><h3 id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span><strong>How it Works</strong></span></a></h3><p>Mood Enhancer uses a fixed system prompt and few-shot examples to generate elaborated prompts. For instance:</p><ul><li><strong>Input:</strong> futuristic city at night</li><li><strong>Mood Enhancer Output:</strong> <em>“A sprawling futuristic city skyline at night, with neon-lit skyscrapers and flying vehicles weaving between the buildings. The streets below glow with holographic billboards and reflected lights. A sense of rainy ambiance with puddles reflecting the vibrant neon signs adds a cyberpunk mood.”</em></li></ul><p>This transformation preserves the core idea while adding imaginative details and atmosphere.</p><figure><img src="https://illustrious-prod.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blog/2025-05-26T05:36:09.376Z/mood enhancer compare.jpg" alt="Image: Mood Enhancer Comparison" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Image: Mood Enhancer Comparison</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="kv-caching-supercharging-llm-efficiency" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kv-caching-supercharging-llm-efficiency"><span><strong>KV Caching: Supercharging LLM Efficiency</strong></span></a></h2><p>Using an LLM raises concerns about <strong>cost and speed</strong>, but Mood Enhancer employs <strong>Key-Value cache reuse</strong> to optimize efficiency.

For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Input:</strong> a lone castle on a hill</li><li><strong>Tag Booster Output:</strong> lone castle on a hill, medieval fortress, cloudy sky, twilight, high-resolution, epic scale</li><li><strong>Mood Enhancer Output:</strong> <em>“A lone medieval castle stands atop a misty hill under a cloud-laden twilight sky.
