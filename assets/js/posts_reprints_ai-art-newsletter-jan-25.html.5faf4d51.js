These opened the door to a stream of improvements and enhancements building on top of these techniques (such as LoRA for diffusion models).</p><img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/ai_art_newsletter_1/personalization_1.png" width="424" height="auto" alt="textual inversion - dreambooth"><p>However, an <strong>upper bound to the quality of the fine-tuned models is naturally the base model</strong> from which it was fine-tuned. In that sense, we can’t neglect Stable Diffusion XL, which was also a significant marker in personalization for open source image generation models. A testimony to that is that even now, many of the popular techniques and models for personalization and controlled generation are based on SDXL. The advanced abilities of SDXL (and models that were released after with similar quality) together with the growing understanding of the semantic roles of different components in the diffusion model architecture raises the question - <br> what can we achieve without further optimization?</p><p><em>cue in the rain of zero shot techniques</em> - 2024 was definitely the year when generating high quality portraits from reference photos was made possible with as little as <strong>a single reference image &amp; without any optimization</strong>. Training free techniques like <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/Ip-Adapter-FaceID" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP adapter FaceID</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/InstantX/InstantID" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InstantID</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/TencentARC/PhotoMaker-V2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photomaker</a> and more came out and demonstrated competitive if not even superior abilities to those of fine-tuned models.</p><img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/ai_art_newsletter_1/instantid.png" width="600" height="auto" alt="instantid"><p>Similarly, image editing and controlled generation - such as image generation with canny / depth / pose constraints made progress too - both thanks to the growing quality of the base models and the community’s growing understanding of the semantic roles different components have (<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/InstantX/InstantStyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instant Style</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Yardenfren/B-LoRA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-LoRA</a>)</p><p><strong>So what’s next?</strong> since the shift of paradigms to DiT and flow matching objectives, additional models came out trying to utilize DiT-based models like Flux and SD3.5 for similar purposes, but so far not quite beating the quality of the SDXL-based ones despite the superior quality of the underlying base model. This could be attributed to the relative lack of understanding of semantic roles of different components of the DiT compared to the Unet. 2025 could be the year when we identify those roles in DiTs as well, unlocking more possibilities with the next generation of image generation models.</p><h2 id="video-generation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#video-generation"><span>Video Generation</span></a></h2>',28),(0,o.Lk)("figure",{class:"image flex flex-col items-center text-center m-0 w-full"},[(0,o.Lk)("video",{alt:"demo4.mp4",autoplay:"",loop:"",autobuffer:"",muted:"",playsinline:""},[(0,o.Lk)("source",{src:"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/video_gen/hunyuan-output.mp4",type:"video/mp4"})])],-1),(0,o.Fv)('<p>As opposed to image generation, with video we still have a way to go.

Video generation is inherently more challenging than image generation due to the need for motion quality, coherence, and consistency. Additionally, video generation requires substantial computational and memory resources, leading to significant generation latency. This often hinders local usage, making many new open video models inaccessible to community hardware without extensive memory optimizations and quantization approaches that impact both inference latency and the quality of generated videos.
