Areas that are complicated make your eyes want to rest on something simple. By interleaving them together, we push and pull the eyes to follow invisible lines around the picture. The goal of the artist is to carefully craft the place where the gaze ends up.</p><p>Regardless of whether we‚Äôre drawing a crowd scene of philosophers or a single portrait, we use areas of rest and areas of complexity to drive the attention of the picture to the important parts. Usually a picture has only one, this is called the ‚Äúfocal point.‚Äù You can think of it as the central argument.</p><p>As a child, I owned the puzzle set for School of Athens. I repeatedly took it apart and put it back together. Even though I didn‚Äôt understand at the time what artistic principle I was looking at, I noticed that some pieces were always easier to locate than others. For example, Plato and Aristotle (in class, I incorrectly identified Aristotle as Socrates, sorry!) sit on the vanishing point, as well as the point of highest contrast for the painting, so they were always easy to place. In comparison, the ceiling was always very hard to assemble. The center is the vanishing point, the focal point, and the point of highest contrast and saturation. The artist really wanted you to understand his central argument.</p><h2 id="what-happens-when-you-have-more-than-one" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happens-when-you-have-more-than-one"><span>What happens when you have more than one?</span></a></h2><p>When you have these two focal points, they compete for priority.

It‚Äôs function is a clue to its presentation. This painting is a secular triptych. Meaning, it‚Äôs a piece of furniture, a medieval home entertainment system of sorts. It doesn‚Äôt rely on first read impressions: it has a lot of little details that you can only see when you step close to it, unlike Raphael‚Äôs painting, which is all the way up on a ceiling, or the niji generation, which is meant to hit you at a glance.</p><p>Raphael‚Äôs organization methods have remained timeless. In contrast, you rarely see paintings organized like Hieronymus Bosch‚Äôs these days: the general modern principle is that the first read must convey a strong focal point: people simply don‚Äôt have the time for a second read.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/lesson2/a0b04940-2773-40d9-a513-1be780cd7609.jpg" alt="Image 7" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Image 7</figcaption></figure><p>I‚Äôve always thought this picture was funny, because it is a list of all the things you ought not do, but listed in extreme detail: (‚Äúyou definitely should not stick a bouquet of flowers into somebody‚Äôs butt, certainly not like the way I have demonstrated here.‚Äù) I‚Äôm sure whichever medieval family owned this piece had some amusement over this.</p><p>When it comes down to it, there are many possible ways to organize a painting. After all, tastes change with time and function. We‚Äôll teach many of these in this course, but today, we‚Äôll focus on a single one.
