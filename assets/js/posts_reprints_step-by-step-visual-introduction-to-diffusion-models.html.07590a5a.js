To do that, we’re going to use some neural network (ignore architecture for now, we’ll get into it soon). If you’re familiar with GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) (Fig. 6), we’re trying to train something similar to the <em>generator network</em>. The only difference is that our network will have an easier job because it doesn’t have to do all the work in one step.</p><figure><img src="https://erdem.pl/869cd128ff69bb1d304675166e8b7b34/gan_diagram_generator.svg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Figure 6: GAN architecture.</p><p>Okay, so why not just use GANs? It took some very smart people a long time to figure out how to achieve decent results with that architecture. It is extremely difficult to train a network to convert some random noise into a meaningful image. The authors of the 2015 paper [1] figured out that switching to a multistep framework and removing some noise at the time is just more efficient and easy to train.</p><blockquote><p>Learning in this framework involves estimating small perturbations to a diffusion process. <strong>Estimating small perturbations is more tractable</strong> than explicitly describing the full distribution with a single, non-analytically-normalizable, potential function.

Both are incorrect. <strong>Diffusion model predicts the entire noise to be removed in a given timestep</strong>. This means that if we have timestep <strong>t=600</strong> then our Diffusion model tries to predict the entire noise on which removal we should get to <strong>t=0</strong>, not <strong>t=599</strong>. I’ll explain everything in a second but first, just look at the step by step reverse diffusion process.</p><p>Please notice that I’ve scaled the number of steps from 1000 to 10.

First, we need to copy the equation for the reverse process from the 2020 paper[2]:</p><p>$$ p_\\theta(x_{0:T}) := p(x_T) \\prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) $$</p><p>where:</p><p>$$ p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t,t), \\sum_\\theta(x_t,t)) $$</p><p>This might seem complicated but it basically says that p θ(x 0:T)p_\\theta(x_{0:T})p θ​(x 0:T​) (diffusion process) is a <strong>chain of gaussian transitions</strong> starting at p(x T)p(x_T)p(x T​) and <strong>iterating T times</strong> using the equation for one diffusion process step p θ(x t−1​∣x t​).</p><p>Now it’s time to explain how the single step works and how to get something to implement.

It’s not set to be constant but rather set to equal β T I\\beta_TI β T​I. This is the same beta from the schedule before. Now the only thing that is left is the first part (mean). To be honest, I’m not the best person to explain what happens next (mostly because I don’t consider myself to be a mathematical mid). There are far smarter people, and one of them is <em>Lilian Weng</em> who described the hard math of the reverse process [6] (also check Appendix A in the 2020 paper [2]). What we need to know from all of this is that</p><p>$$ \\mu_\\theta(x_t,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} \\left( x_t - \\frac{1 - \\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar\\alpha_t}} \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) \\right) $$</p><p>and that gives us</p><p>$$ x_{t-1} = \\mathcal{N}\\left(x_{t-1}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}}(x_t - \\frac{\\beta_t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar\\alpha_t}} \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)), \\sqrt{\\beta_t}\\epsilon\\right) $$</p><p>which we can use to calculate the output value for a given timestep t</p><p>$$ x_{t-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_t}} \\left(x_t - \\frac{\\beta_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar\\alpha}} \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t,t)\\right) + \\sqrt{\\beta_t}\\epsilon $$</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>ϵ θ(x t,t)\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t,t)ϵ θ​(x t​,t) is our <strong>model’s output</strong> (predicted noise)</li></ul><p>As shown in Fig. 9, the last iteration of the reverse process doesn’t add the noise β t ϵ\\sqrt{\\beta_t}\\epsilon β t​​ϵ to the output.

As described previously, each time we predict the noise using a neural network, we subtract part of it and move to the next step. That is how the diffusion process works. But <strong>what will happen if we just subtract all the noise?</strong> I’ve generated an example of such subtraction for every timestep (&lt;1,50&gt; with a linear schedule).</p><blockquote><p><strong>Notice!</strong> Because this is a reverse process when we say <strong>t=1</strong>, the value of the β t\\beta_t β t​ is set to β T−t+1\\beta_{T-t+1}β T−t+1​, where <strong>T</strong> is the total number of steps.

At t=0 that input is just a random noise. The Image on the right is the noise predicted by the neural network. The Image on the left is just the input at step t with the whole noise subtracted. This is done separately at each step. I’ve picked only some of the steps, but if you want to see all of them please check the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13UCkMZCs_AktbkEAAmJ_jeumuZlGFC0e/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full diffusion process with noise removed (gDrive)</a>.</p><p>As said at the start of the article, a diffusion model used in the diffusion process works similarly to GAN’s generator only worse. Well, maybe not worse but rather worse in one-step denoising. If you look at the result of removing the entire noise generated at <em>t=1</em>, you can see that the result is kind of similar to the end image generated by the whole process. The reason for it is that we’re training the network to predict the whole noise, not the diff. A perfect model should predict exactly the noise that would produce the right image. It doesn’t because it would require learning exact data distribution, which is practically impossible.</p><p>There are 2 things you can take from this example:</p><ol><li>You can use <strong>fewer timesteps in your schedule</strong> when doing the inference after the model is trained.</li><li>You can use a <strong>different schedule</strong> when doing the inference.</li></ol><p>First should be obvious when your network predicts the noise that is already quite good, you can make larger “jumps”. Larger because the β\\beta β range remains the same, only the slope changes. The second is less straightforward, but you can use different schedules with different slopes (e.g. you can train with a <em>linear schedule</em> and inference with a <em>cosine schedule</em>).</p><h2 id="architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#architecture"><span>Architecture</span></a></h2><p>Finally, we can move to discussing the architecture.</p><p>For those who like reading pytorch visualizations, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XVwlD8wuTazW2myf4sV-TZF_YkIfwL7z/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE (gDrive)</a> is a full model (including label embedder).</p><p>Figure 11: Diffusion model architecture.</p><p>Model architecture is a modified U-Net [7] architecture.

If you look at Fig. 8, it shows as if the diffusion model just processes the input image with noise. This isn’t true, each step in the process adds embedding with information about the current timestep and prompt (if the model supports prompting, first diffusion models weren’t). To do that, we need to use <strong>sinusoidal encoding for encoding timestep t</strong>, and some kind of <strong>embedder for our prompt</strong>. I’ve described how this type of encoding works in my article about <a href="https://erdem.pl/2021/05/understanding-positional-encoding-in-transformers#positional-encoding-visualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positional encoding in transformers</a>.</p><h5 id="embedder" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#embedder"><span>Embedder</span></a></h5><p>Embedder could be any network that embeds your prompt. In the first conditional diffusion models (ones with prompting) there was no reason to use complicated embedders. E.g. in the network I’ve trained for this article, I’ve used the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIFAR-10 dataset</a> which has only 10 classes. In this case, the job of the embedder is just to encode these classes. If you’re working with more complicated datasets, especially those without annotations, you might want to use embedders like CLIP. Then you’ll be able to prompt the model with any text you want to generate images. At the same time, you need to use that embedder in the training process.</p><p>Outputs from the positional encoding and text embedder are added to each other and passed into downsample and upsample blocks.</p><h5 id="resnet-block" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#resnet-block"><span>ResNet Block</span></a></h5><figure><img src="https://erdem.pl/static/18fc014ed4e2d9fe4d1439b3431ccad9/d38a6/conv_block.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Figure 12: ResNet block</p><p>The First block we’re going to discuss is ResNet Block.

That’s it, now we repeat the entire process until it converges and the model is ready.</p><h2 id="conclusions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusions"><span>Conclusions</span></a></h2><p>I know that the article is quite lengthy, and it could be shortened to half of it (if we drop the math part), but I hope it’s easy to read and understand. This is just an explanation of the early versions of the diffusion models. It doesn’t include some further work like CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance [5]), negative prompting, LORAs, ControlNets, and many others. I’ll try to describe all of that in the upcoming articles, but for now, let me summarize the most important things you should remember about diffusion models:</p><ul><li>The Diffusion process consists of <strong>forward diffusion</strong> and <strong>reverse diffusion</strong></li><li>Forward diffusion is used to add noise to the input image using a <strong>schedule</strong></li><li>There are different types of schedules (we’ve used linear), and they decide how much noise is added at the given step <strong>t</strong></li><li>We don’t have to use an iterative process to add noise, it can be done in one step with the equation described in the <strong>Real noising process</strong> section</li><li>Reverse diffusion consists of multiple steps in which a <strong>small amount of noise is removed at every step</strong> (<strong>equation</strong>)</li><li><strong>Diffusion model predicts the entire noise</strong>, not the difference between step <strong>t</strong> and <strong>t-1</strong></li><li>You might use a different schedule for inference than for training (including a different number of steps)</li><li>Diffusion model uses a <strong>modified U-Net architecture</strong></li><li>To add information about timestep <strong>t</strong> and prompt, we use <strong>sinusoidal encoding</strong> and <strong>text embedder</strong></li><li>Some of the ResNet blocks are replaced with <strong>Self-Attention blocks</strong></li></ul><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#references"><span>References</span></a></h2><ol><li><a
