I completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should be allocated to public services.</p><p>There are several reasons why space programmes should be abandoned. Firstly， it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also come at a huge cost to the government. Secondly， these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply vanity projects for politicians. Finally, many missions to space fail completely， and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives. The Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.</p><p>I believe that the money from space programmes should go to vital public services instead.lt is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects. Furthermore, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on every member of society. For example, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. If governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could be lifted out of poverty or given a better quality of life.</p><p>In conclusion， my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society， and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative.While a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, I believe that the ability to co-operate is more important. On the one hand, competition can be a great source of motivation for children. When teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of competitiveness into lessons, it can encourage children to work harder to outdo the other pupils in the class. This kind of healthy rivalry may help to build children&#39;s self confidence, while pushing them to work independently and progress more quickly. When these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews. It can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.</p><p>On the other hand,it is perhaps even more important to prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation. In the workplace， adults are expected to work in teams， follow instructions given by their superiors, or supervise and support the more junior members of staff. Team collaboration skills are much more useful than a competitive determination to win. This is the attitude that I believe schools should foster in young people. Instead of promoting the idea that people are either winners or losers, teachers could show children that they gain more from working together.</p><p>In conclusion, I can understand why people might want to encourage competitiveness in children, but it seems to me that a co-operative attitude is much more desirable in adult life.</p><p>上面这篇essay就是我们刚刚写出来的完整范文了，请按照下面的步骤进行范文分析：</p><p>4.看看每段有几个句子？我是不是按照开头段2句话，主体段5句话，总结段1句话这个结构来写的？</p><p>5.把每段的连接词自己划出来。看看主体段我用的是“firstly,secondly,thirdly”结构还是“观点，解释，举例”结构？</p><p>6.把咱们课上讲的那些9分好词都划出来。</p><h1 id="作业胞罔叨学" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#作业胞罔叨学"><span>作业胞罔叨学</span></a></h1><p>1.阅读《跟雅思考官Simon学写作》中 枪支 全球化 水资源 三节，并完成课后练习及词伙句伙练习</p><p>2.背单词 《鸭圈雅思核心词》中大作文部分</p><p>3.在微信群中汇报自己今天的学习情况，晒作业，并打卡；如果有问题，请在为微信群内提问</p><h1 id="第八课-问题与对策题型" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#第八课-问题与对策题型"><span>第八课 问题与对策题型</span></a></h1><p>讲义</p><p>In many countries schools have severe problems with student behaviour.What do you think are the causes of this?What solutions can</p><p>you suggest?</p><p>第一步，读题， 划出题干关键词第二步，列提纲</p><p>1.开头 段： 主 题句 (student behaviour in schools) $^ { + }$ 答案(variety of reasons,steps can be taken to tackle)</p><p>第三步，拓展主体段思路主体段：造成这个问题的原因(causes)</p><p>(2)parents not strict(too lenient),(3)children don&#39;t accept teachers) instructions or school rules, (4)teachers^ fault,no control,band classroom management,(5)influence of celebrities who are a bad example</p><p>In my opinion,(1)three main factors are to blame for they way young people behave at school nowadays.Firstly,(2)modern parents tend to be too lenient or permissive.(3)Many children become accustomed to getting whatever they want,and they find it difficult to accept the demands of teachers or the limits on them by school rules.Secondly,(4)if teachers cannot control their students,there must be an issue with the quality of classroom management training or support within schools.Finally,(5)children are influenced by the behaviour of celebrities,many of whom set the example that success can be achieved without finishing school. 圈留学 鸭圈 主体段：我的解决建议(solutions)</p><p>(1)my suggested solutions (2)parents set rules for children,(3)use punishments,actions have consequences,(4)schools train teachers and parents,discipline techniques,better communication,(5)famous people act as role models</p><p>(1)Student behaviour can certainly be improved.I believe that (2)the change must start with parents,who need to be persuaded that it is important to set firm rules for their children.
