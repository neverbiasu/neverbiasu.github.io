Niji Academy is an experimental program designed to help you learn drawing faster, using Niji. We have lectures every week, but we&#39;re posting the exercises here, so you can reference them, if you can&#39;t make it to lecture! The key to understanding a picture is taking accurate measurements with your eyes. This is a good exercise for training your hand-eye coordination and building your understanding of the subject matter.</p><h2 id="step-1-using-niji-style-cute-select-a-drawing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-using-niji-style-cute-select-a-drawing"><span>Step 1: Using niji --style cute, select a drawing</span></a></h2><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/study1/c01d0f47-388a-4e2e-923d-ee008205bdbb.jpeg" alt="Step 1" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Step 1</figcaption></figure><h2 id="step-2-using-only-straight-lines-make-a-low-poly-silhouette-of-the-drawing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-2-using-only-straight-lines-make-a-low-poly-silhouette-of-the-drawing"><span>Step 2: Using only straight lines, make a low-poly silhouette of the drawing</span></a></h2><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/study1/011c6ebd-206a-4085-a6fb-c7b41b009544.jpeg" alt="Step 2" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Step 2</figcaption></figure><h2 id="step-3-set-the-previous-step-to-30-make-a-new-layer-and-using-only-straight-lines-define-the-general-shapes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-3-set-the-previous-step-to-30-make-a-new-layer-and-using-only-straight-lines-define-the-general-shapes"><span>Step 3: Set the previous step to 30%, Make a new layer, and, using only straight lines, define the general shapes</span></a></h2><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/study1/9c17f638-1758-4ca3-bcd1-d118a54fee02.jpeg" alt="Step 3" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Step 3</figcaption></figure><h2 id="step-4-set-the-previous-step-to-30-make-a-new-layer-and-refine-the-lines-with-curves" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-4-set-the-previous-step-to-30-make-a-new-layer-and-refine-the-lines-with-curves"><span>Step 4: Set the previous step to 30%, Make a new layer, and refine the lines with curves</span></a></h2><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/study1/bbcac3a0-85f3-4cc7-95ec-b32e7cd1b2af.jpeg" alt="Step 4" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Step 4</figcaption></figure><h2 id="step-5-turn-the-previous-step-off-and-refine-the-lines-more-detail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-5-turn-the-previous-step-off-and-refine-the-lines-more-detail"><span>Step 5: Turn the previous step off, and refine the lines more detail</span></a></h2><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/study1/dec56fd9-c960-4f84-a4a1-d5d613c13d8e.jpeg" alt="Step 5" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Step 5</figcaption></figure><h2 id="checking-your-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#checking-your-work"><span>Checking your work</span></a></h2><h3 id="step-6-overlay-your-work-on-top-of-the-original-drawing-to-see-the-diff" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-6-overlay-your-work-on-top-of-the-original-drawing-to-see-the-diff"><span>Step 6: Overlay your work on top of the original drawing, to see the diff</span></a></h3><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/study1/597962da-e155-4ed5-8056-786e6ffa86a4.jpeg" alt="Step 6" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Step 6</figcaption></figure><h3 id="step-7-put-the-3-drawings-side-by-side-and-nudge-your-study-using-the-original-and-diff" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-7-put-the-3-drawings-side-by-side-and-nudge-your-study-using-the-original-and-diff"><span>Step 7: Put the 3 drawings side by side, and nudge your study using the original and diff</span></a></h3><p>(do not trace the diff directly) Repeat until you are satisfied.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/nijijourney/study1/79424cad-395f-4e78-8cef-56aaf0ec6bc0.jpeg" alt="Step 7" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Step 7</figcaption></figure><h3 id="step-8-done-show-the-study-to-blk-cat-with-the-submit-command" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-8-done-show-the-study-to-blk-cat-with-the-submit-command"><span>Step 8: Done!
