So try to avoid making it too complicated.</p><p>There are 3 simple rules to writing a good video prompt:</p><ul><li>describe only what you can see, not what the character feels on the inside.</li><li>describe a primary action (what is happening)</li><li>describe a secondary action (what is flopping around as a result of the action)</li></ul><p>For example, note the difference between:</p><blockquote><p>Anime prince with blue eyes and blonde hair looking around in confusion</p></blockquote><p>vs.</p><blockquote><p>An anime prince with blonde hair and blue eyes turns his head left and right. His cape billows behind him as he pivots, while loose strands of hair sway across his face as he wears a confused expression.</p></blockquote><p>By paying attention to secondary motion, we can make the scene much more lively!</p><p>Of course, all that motion can be distracting. (Sometimes maybe you do just want the guy to turn his head), so be sure to include as much and as little detail as you need.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>If you don&#39;t wanna think about all this, you can certainly also put in a picture with no prompt as well!
