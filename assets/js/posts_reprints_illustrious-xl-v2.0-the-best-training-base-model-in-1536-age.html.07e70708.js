Training with a small dataset to fill these gaps often leads to overfitting at certain resolutions. This meant that the model would associate specific resolutions with specific concepts, making it unreliable for diverse generations.</p><p>A useful analogy is the &quot;wide shot&quot; effect. If the dataset commonly features wide shots, the model will naturally generate smaller figures when given a wide-shot resolution, as this is how it has learned to generalize.</p><p>To resolve this, Illustrious XL v2.0 required an extensive dataset and large-scale training—comparable to the original v0.1 training—to eliminate bias across resolutions and datasets.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/reprints/illustrious/v2.0/0.png" alt="Example 1" loading="lazy"><em>prompt: &quot;stylish, no humans, city light, black theme, dim lighting, high contrast, night sky, masterpiece, absurdres, depth of field, butterflies, extremely aesthetic, absurdres, wallpaper, panorama, city background, neon, milky way, photo background, 512x512 generation&quot;</em></p><p><img src="/assets/images/reprints/illustrious/v2.0/1.png" alt="Example 2" loading="lazy"><em>prompt: &quot;The image features two characters,each with distinct black and white outfits,standing back-to-back.

Hopefully, Illustrious v2 and above, will reach a certain point - compared to existing models.

Take a look at FLUX Schnell&#39;s result. It performs well in prompt adherence but lack illustrative quality and style.

Almost every model we actually see in production are instruction tuned/ or &#39;finetuned&#39; variants. This is because, freshly pretrained model, does not mean it will generate good / preferred results. Almost all models go through aesthetic tuning stage for preference optimizations, but aesthetic tuning can significantly reduce the model&#39;s &quot;additional training capability&quot;. Many fine-tuned aesthetic models perform well visually but are problematic to train with.</p><p>Aesthetic models, or wrongly trained models are a disaster to train with - this was the fundamental reason why Illustrious XL was built. We wanted the model to start training with. However, aesthetic models do look better, no matter what - even if it&#39;s just simply merged with LoRA or other models.</p><h2 id="aesthetic-tuning-and-performance-impact" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aesthetic-tuning-and-performance-impact"><span>Aesthetic Tuning and Performance Impact</span></a></h2><p>We introduce the aesthetic-tuned variant of Illustrious XL v2.0—v2.0 Aesthetic. This model balances generalization and aesthetic refinement while maintaining compatibility with v0.1~v2.0-trained LoRAs.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/reprints/illustrious/v2.0/5.png" alt="KDE plot of v2.0 and v2.0 Aesthetic variants" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>KDE plot of v2.0 and v2.0 Aesthetic variants</figcaption></figure><p>Aesthetic tuning enhances the model&#39;s ability to generate visually appealing images, as shown in automated model evaluations.
