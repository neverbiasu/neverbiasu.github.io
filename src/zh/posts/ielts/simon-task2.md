# 第二课 开头段讲义  

大作文的四种题型：  

1.双边讨论(discussion)   
2.比较利弊(opinion)   
3.问题与对策(problem and solution)   
4.两段式(two-part question)  

第一种 双边讨论(discussion)的开头段  

Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups,while others believe that it is better for them to study  我的观点-sometimes better alone,usually better in a group  

开头段：  

『改写 题目』 People have different views about the effectiveness of group study as opposed to working alone.『我的观点』While there are some benefits to study independently,l believe that group work is  

usually more productive.  

第二种 比较利弊(opinion)的开头段  

Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.To what extend do you agree or disagree?  

提纲： 题干关键词-community service for all teenagers我的答案-三种： (完全)同意； (完全不)不同意；折中(如有必要;一般情况不要去写)

第三种问题与对策(Problemand solution)的开头段

提纲：题干关键词-criminals reoffend我的答案-给出一些理由，一些解决措施(政府，社区)  

『改写题目』 It is true that punishments do not always deter criminals from committing more crimes.『我的答案』 There are various reasons why offenders repeatedly break the law,but governments could certainly take steps to address this issue.  

第四种 两段式(Two-part question)的开头段 As most people spend α major part of their adult life at work,job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being.What  

# factors contribute to job satisfaction?How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?

『改写题目』 Work plays a central role in our lives,and we would all like to feel fulfilled professionally.While a variety of factors may lead to job satisfaction,it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work.

#   

Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

咱们写一个 完全反对 的主体段先用3分钟想一些观点：  

-disagree forseveral reasons -school timetable is full,no time for community service -students\` work in other subjects would be affected -teenagers might not want to do it(reluctant,no motivation)  

然后组成一个主体段：  

There are several reasons why l would argue against having compulsory community service for secondary school students.Firstly,the school curriculum is already full with important academic subjects,such as maths,science and languages.For example,l remember having an extremely busy timetable when l was at high school,and it would not have been possible to add to it.Secondly,students\` performance in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were taken by charity Work or neighbourhood improvement schemes.Finally,l believe that teenage students would be reluctant to take part in any programmes of obligatory work,and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour.  

再来回顾一下这一段，5句话，1.中心句 2.Firstly(增加一句举例)  

# 3.Secondly 4.Finally  

请记住：连接词并不会影响你的词汇分数，它们只是连接词，考官不会因为你用了"Firstly,Secondly,Finally"这样简单的连接词就扣你的词汇分数，也不会因为你用复杂的连接词给你加分。考官想看的是你的主题词。

Secondly,students^ performance in other subjects Would be affected if valuable study time were taken by charity work or neighbourhood improvement schemes.Finally,l believe that teenage students would be reluctant to take part in any programmes of obligatory work,and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour.  

观点，解释，举例  

Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

-voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive -students more motivated if they can choose -gain work experience,self confidence,skills -good for CVs,career,university admissions,employers  

『观点』 On the other hand, the opportunity to do voluntary community service should be extremely positive for high school students. 『解释』By making these programmes optional,schools would ensure that only motivated students took part.These young people would gain valuable experience in an adult working environment,which could help to build ■ ? their self confidence and enhance their skills.Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve school leaves^ career prospects.  

「举例』 For example, a period of voluntary work experience might impress a university admissions officer or a future employer.  

再来回顾一下这一段，5句话，观点，解释（大概2-3句）然后举例。

开头段：改写题目+给出观点(agree-public services instead of space   

The money spent by governments on space programmes would be better spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals.To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

主题词-government spending 观点-agree,public services instead of space projects  

Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on space exploration programmes.l completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money,and that the funds should be allocated to public services.  

总结段：改写开头段观点即可(spent on services that benefits us al)  

In conclusion,my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefits all members of society,and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.  

这样，我们就完整的写完了这篇作文。  
实际上如果你按照以上的文章结构去写，基本上可以拿到6分左右了。那是什么使我们的作文上7-9分呢？ 就是以下这些主题词（或者叫词伙）了：  
: space programmes,exploration,missions,projects,travel,research  
· funds should be allocated  
· should be abandoned  
· facilities and equipment come at a huge cost

The money spent by governments on space programmes would be better spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals.To whtee子  

Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on space exploration programmes. I completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should be allocated to public services.  

There are several reasons why space programmes should be abandoned. Firstly， it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also come at a huge cost to the government. Secondly， these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply vanity projects for politicians. Finally, many missions to space fail completely， and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives. The Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.  

I believe that the money from space programmes should go to vital public services instead.lt is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects. Furthermore, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on every member of society. For example, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. If governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could be lifted out of poverty or given a better quality of life.  

In conclusion， my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society， and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives. (275 words, band 9)

On the one hand,(1)competition can be a great source of motivation for children.(2)When teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of competitiveness into lessons,it encourage children to work harder to outdo the other pupils in the class.(3)This kind of healthy rivalry may help to build children's self confidence,while pushing them to work independently and progress more quickly.(4)When these children leave school,their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews.(5)lt can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.

(1)co-operation even more important,(2)e.g. at work(teams,follow bos's instructions,helpjuniorstaff),(3)collaboration more useful than winning,(4)better attitude for young people,(5)working together  

On the other hand,(1)it is perhaps even more important to prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation.(2)ln the workplace,adults are expected to work in teams,follow instructions given by their superiors,or supervise and support the more junior members of staff.(3)Team collaboration skills are much more useful than a competitive determination to win.(4)This is the attitude that I believe schools should foster in young people.(5)lnstead of promoting the idea that people either winners or losers,teachers could show children that

Some people think that α sense of competition in children should be encouraged.Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than complete become more useful adults.Discuss both these  

# views and give your own opinion.  

People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative.While a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life,l believe that the ability to co-operate is more important.  

总结段：改写答案  

In conclusion,l can understand why people might want to encourage competitiveness in children,but it seems to me that a co-operative is much more desirable in adult life.  

学习这样的文章结构，像这样列提纲并不是特别难的一件事，大概练个四五篇你就可以做到行文有逻辑，思路清晰。但作文上7分难在什么地方呢？就是下面这些主题词（或者叫词伙）  

competition/co-operation;competitive,co-operative,co-operate,compet itiveness  

· a spirit of competition   
a source of motivation   
· introduce an element of competitiveness   
· outdo other pupils,healthy rivalry  

· build self confidence,determination aspects of adult life · superiors,junior members of staff · team collaboration skills : attitude that schools should foster : promoting the idea · a co-operative attitude is more desirable 测试  

Some people think that α sense of competition in children should be encouraged.Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.  

People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative.While a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, I believe that the ability to co-operate is more important. On the one hand, competition can be a great source of motivation for children. When teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of competitiveness into lessons, it can encourage children to work harder to outdo the other pupils in the class. This kind of healthy rivalry may help to build children's self confidence, while pushing them to work independently and progress more quickly. When these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews. It can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.  

On the other hand,it is perhaps even more important to prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation. In the workplace， adults are expected to work in teams， follow instructions given by their superiors, or supervise and support the more junior members of staff. Team collaboration skills are much more useful than a competitive determination to win. This is the attitude that I believe schools should foster in young people. Instead of promoting the idea that people are either winners or losers, teachers could show children that they gain more from working together.  

In conclusion, I can understand why people might want to encourage competitiveness in children, but it seems to me that a co-operative attitude is much more desirable in adult life.

In many countries schools have severe problems with student behaviour.What do you think are the causes of this?What solutions can you suggest?  

It is true that the behaviour of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent years. There are a variety of possible  people behave at school nowadays. Firstly, modern parents tend to be too lenient or permissive. Many children become accustomed to getting whatever they want, and they find it difficult to accept the demands of teachers or the limits imposed on them by school rules. Secondly, if teachers cannot control their students, there must be an issue with the quality of classroom management training or support within schools. Finally， children are influenced by the behaviour of celebrities， many of whom set the example that success can be achieved without finishing school.  

Student behaviour can certainly be improved. I believe that the change must start with parents, who need to be persuaded that it is important to set firm rules for their children.When children misbehave or break the rules, parents should use reasonable punishments to demonstrate that actions have consequences. Also， schools could play an important role in training both teachers and parents to use effective disciplinary techniques, and in improving the communication between both groups. At the same time， famous people,such as musicians and football players, need to understand the responsibility that they have 一 to act as role models to children.  

In conclusion, schools will continue to face discipline problems unless parents, teachers and public figures set clear rules and demonstrate the right behaviour themselves.

News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence these decisions? Do we become used to bad news, and would it be better if more good news was reported?  

It is true that editors have to make difficult decisions about which news stories they broadcast or publish， and their choices are no doubt influenced by a variety of factors. In my opinion, we are exposed to too much bad news, and I would welcome a greater emphasis on good news.  

Editors face a range of considerations when deciding what news stories to focus on.Firstly, I imagine that they have to consider whether viewers or readers will be interested enough to choose their television channel or their newspaper over competing providers.Secondly, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore prioritise stories that are in the public interest.Finally, editors are probably under some pressure from the owners who employ them. For example, a newspaper owner might have particular political views that he or she wants to promote.  

It seems to me that people do become accustomed to negative news. We are exposed on a daily basis to stories about war, crime, natural disasters and tragic human suffering around the world. I believe that such repeated exposure gradually desensitises people,and we become more cynical about the world and more sceptical that we can do anything to change it. I would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natural disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities. This kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.  

In conclusion,it must be extremely difficult for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see a more positive approach to this vital public service.
