# Study 2: Notan

## What Does "Notan" Mean in Art?

"Notan" is a Japanese word for "light-dark harmony." Artists use "notan studies" to try out different arrangements of light and dark in a painting without worrying about colors, textures, or small details.

Can you express a full picture in only 2 colors?

The objective of this exercise is to organize areas of light and shadow. Unlike last week, where we start with something with strong lines, this week, we must start with something rendered, with a good 3D shape.

When picking a reference picture, be careful to pick one with a single strong light source: here are some tips on what to avoid:

Don’t pick something that is very 2D

Don’t pick something with too many light sources. One single light source is optimal.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Put down a rough sketch of the shape being drawn

### Step 2: Draw the terminator line, where the light turns into the shadow

### Step 6: Turn the lines off and stylize the places where extra shading needs to be added to see the entire picture

## Tips

- Keep the end goal in mind: a picture that looks finished with only black and white.
- Avoid drawing structural lines to prevent the drawing from looking flat.
- It’s okay to deviate slightly from the reference as long as the final picture is clear.
