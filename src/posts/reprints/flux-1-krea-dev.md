# FLUX.1 Krea [dev]: An ‘Opinionated’ Text-to-Image Model

The BFL model garden just got an exciting update: We are proud to release **FLUX.1 Krea [dev]**, developed in collaboration with [Krea AI](http://krea.ai/blog/flux-krea-open-source-release). **FLUX.1 Krea [dev]** is a new state-of-the-art open-weights model for text-to-image generation that overcomes the oversaturated 'AI look' to achieve new levels of photorealism with its distinctive aesthetic approach.

## An ‘Opinionated’ Text-to-Image Model

FLUX.1 Krea [dev] is the open weights version of [Krea 1](http://krea.ai/krea-1), offering strong performance with highly distinctive aesthetics and exceptional realism. It has been trained with the goal to generate more realistic and diverse images that do not contain oversaturated textures, a known issue in text-to-image generation. Due to these properties, we call FLUX.1 Krea [dev] ‘opinionated’ - a text-to-image model that offers its users pleasant surprises in the form of diverse, visually interesting images.

Despite its idiosyncrasies, FLUX.1 Krea [dev] outperforms previous open text-to-image models and is on par with closed solutions like FLUX1.1 [pro] in human preference assessments. Moreover it is architecturally compatible with the FLUX.1 [dev] ecosystem and serves as a flexible base model for customization for down-stream applications.

The weights of FLUX.1 Krea [dev] are now available in the BFL [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev). Commercial Licenses can are available in the [BFL Licensing Portal](https://bfl.ai/pricing/licensing). Our partners [FAL](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux/krea), [Replicate](http://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-krea-dev), [Runware](https://runware.ai/models#image-flux), [DataCrunch](https://datacrunch.io/managed-endpoints/flux-krea) and [TogetherAI](http://www.together.ai/models/flux-1-krea-dev) provide API endpoints for easy integration.

## Key Features of FLUX.1 Krea [dev]

The key features of our most recent open-weights text-to-image model are

- State-of-the-art open text-to-image generation
- Highly distinctive aesthetics that overcome the common "AI look" problem
- Exceptional realism and image quality
- Enhanced flexibility for customization
- Compatibility with the FLUX.1 [dev] architecture and ecosystem

## Collaborative Model Development

This joint project between BFL and Krea demonstrates the value of collaborative model development between foundation model and applied AI labs. By providing a specialized and flexible base model tailored for down-stream finetuning, we helped Krea to achieve previously unfeasible results.

FLUX.1 Krea [dev] showcases how targeted collaboration between foundation model developers and application-focused teams can push the boundaries of open AI image generation.
